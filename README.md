# RFM Analysis and Cluster Analysis

This project is used for Advanced Assignment on RevoU Data Analytics Program.

Gustavo just started an e-commerce startup based in Portugal that recently opened an online website to sell their product. Fortunately, Gustavo is launching  their website when the covid-19 hits and making  them grow faster than ever. However, Gustavo is still not using targeted marketing which hurts their marketing budget as only a fraction of their user comes back to their website. Gustavo needs help to increase their marketing conversion rate by doing more targeted marketing using customer segmentation so that it will not hurt their budget.

1. **EDA**
2. **RFM Analysis**
